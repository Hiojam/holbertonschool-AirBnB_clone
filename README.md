# AirBnB clone - The console
Below is a brief description of our first console project in Python!

## description of the project
The project consists of writing a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step in creating your first full web app â€“ the AirBnB clone.

This first step is very important because it will integrate what we built during this project with all the other projects that follow:
HTML/CSS templates, database storage, API, front-end integration...

## description of the command interpreter:
This repository contains the Airbnb console clone.

It is a command interpreter:
The command interpreter, like a shell, can take input from the user and perform certain tasks to manipulate object instances.

It is also an interpreter of classes:
The BaseModel class and several other classes that inherit from it: Amenity, City, State, Place, Review

### how to start it

$
$ cat test_help
